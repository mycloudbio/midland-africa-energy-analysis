*Peak Generation Analysis Final Documentation, Conclusion, and Suggestion
Peak hours are between 9am to 4pm
From 7am power generation starts climbing and falls off by 4pm onwards
Almost 0 power generation from 5pm onwards
Based on this analysis Battery charging optimization should be schedule during peak PV

* Load Pattern Recognition Final Documentation, Conclusion, and Suggestion
Load demand is quite minimal outside the peak periods which gradually increase from 1pm to 7pm
Load power drop drastically around 6pm, quite an ANOMALY
Very low Load power was observed from 8pm onwards, during midnight to early morning hours.
High mid-day to evening demand, possibly misaligned with peak solar generation.


* Load Shaving Opportunities Final Documentation, Conclusion, and Suggestion
Started off with grouping data by hour of day to find average load across the day, then identified peak demand periods using PLoad(W).
Futhermore, i compared load peaks with available PV generation (charger power(W)) and battery power (batt power(W)).
The goal was to assess mismatch and cheak if load shifting is neccessary or shaving strategies
I observed that Load spikes between 6 PM and 9 PM, battery output is partially supporting load also
Implement smart load control systems, and Increase battery storage to cover peak periods might be something we should consider


*System Optimization Timing Final Documentation, Conclusion, and Suggestion
Started off with Identify the most efficient time windows to operate electrical loads - Grouped the data by hour and calculated Mean Value.
Futhermore, i observed Charger Power is highest betweenee 9am and 1pm, Battery is charging, and Load is lowest
Battery heavily discharged between 7am and 3pm - highest discharge happened around 9am


* Battery Usage & Health Assessment Final Documentation, Conclusion, and Suggestion
Morning Period between 12am – 6am - Battery stays nearly constant at ~72 W, indicating no active charging or discharging possibly idle, 
or minor trickle use Then from 7am – 3am Battery enters deep discharge, reaching -489 W at 9am 
This indicates high demand within this period of the day Late Afternoon period between 4pm – 6pm Battery transitions back into positive territory, 
showing charging starts again Evening 7pm – 11pm Sudden charging spike at 7pm (473 W) despite charger reading 0.00 could suggest grid charging, 
or anomaly Then returns to standby mode ~72 W from 8pm onward - Suspicious spike at 7pm (473 W) despite 0.00 charging power 
Possibly an anomaly, grid supplement, or logging error, it needs further investigation!



* Summary:
While the system is performing within expected parameters for an off-grid setup, the lack of grid fallback introduces vulnerability during early morning hours. 
Strategic scheduling and capacity planning will enhance system resilience and optimize battery health.

No Grid Failover will result to Full System Vulnerability (Entire load depends on PV generation and battery reserve).

I'm Suggesting Introduction of grid failover for critical loads and expand battery capacity to support vulnerable hours.
